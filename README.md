 ### This workshop uses a Reveal.js template for UBC presentations

 This template uses all the default functionality that comes with the core [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) library, but with a single <code>ubc.css</code> style sheet. The remaining themed stylesheets have been removed.

 The UBC stylesheet includes:
 - a dark blue UBC logo in the bottom left corner of all slides.
 - UBC [common look and feel colours](https://clf.ubc.ca/design-specifications/#colours) for text
 - a <code>div</code> class <code>"image-slide"</code> for using text on top of beautiful photos of UBC.
 - a new folder <code>img</code> with two large photos of campus from the [UBC Brand and Marketing Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134760388@N08/) account
